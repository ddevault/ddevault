# Nothing to see here

But there is something to see [here â‡¢](https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn)

## Regarding GitHub Sponsors

I accept donations via GitHub sponsors, but I plan on leaving the platform in
the foreseeable future. If you would like to support my work, please consider
using [my donation portal](https://drewdevault.com/donate) instead, or [buying a
sourcehut subscription](https://sourcehut.org), both of which are 100% free and
open-source software.
